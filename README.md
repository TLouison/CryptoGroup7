# CryptoGroup7
RPI Cryptography Final Project

## How to Run
To run our code, you first run:
```python3
python3 server.py
```
You will be prompted to enter a port number. Select any valid port number for the server to run on in localhost (127.0.0.1).
  
Next, you must run:
```python3
python3 client.py
```
You must then enter the same port as the server is running.
You will be prompted to choose your PKC and Key Exchange Protocol.
